# Face Generation

In this project, I've defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. My goal was to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible. At the end of the notebook, I was able to visualize the results of the trained Generator to see how it performs; my generated samples look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
