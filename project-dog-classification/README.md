# Dog Classification App

In this project, I built a pipeline that includes pre-prossessing user-supplied images and using a CNN to classify dog breeds. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
