## Project 1: [Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/yhejazi/deep-learning-nd/tree/master/project-bikesharing)

In this project, I built a fully-connected neural network from scratch to predict daily bike rental ridership.

## Project 2: [Dog Classification App](https://github.com/yhejazi/deep-learning-nd/tree/master/project-dog-classification)

In this project, I built a pipeline that includes pre-prossessing user-supplied images and using a CNN to classify dog breeds. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## Project 3: [TV Script Generation](https://github.com/yhejazi/deep-learning-nd/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation)

In this project, I generated my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I used a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons to train the network to generate a new, "fake" TV script.
